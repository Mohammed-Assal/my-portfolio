      content="W I am Mohammed Assal, a full-stack developer specialized in the MERN
      stack. I began my journey in web application development two years
      ago, and during this time, I became passionate about MERN stack
      technologies, delving deep into its libraries and associated
      frameworks. Additionally, I have knowledge of other programming
      languages. I gained practical experience through an internship at a
      company, as well as freelancing on various projects, which has helped
      me enhance my skills and deliver innovative solutions for web
      applications."
